## GemPT - Gemini in any place where *OpenAI compatible* or *Ollama Compatible* 
#### This was actually created for Xcode-Beta + macOS 26, to use Gemini instead of ChatGPT
#### But it works accross many services, like BoltAI and more. ( since they still have gemini 1.5 only, which means you cant use gemini at all.. Until now bissshhh!) For BoltAI just put Ollama and set the port to whatever you want, and then set up the app to be on the same port. 
#### It's cute, lightweight, doesn't require a terminal, and lives in your menubar, and took an unexpected amount of time to develop haha just so i wouldnt have to run terminal or an overkill professional application. So I hope someone else can use it and finds it to be a good tool <3 
#### Application is signed and notarized by apple, sandboxed and requires no permissions from the user.
#### Available free on the AppStore. Go get it there, or here. but leave me a review pls haha thanks :)

### COMING SOON. Custom prompt for Xcode! No Prompt Mode! By using this app you will soon have the ability to turn off the hidden prompt that's by default injected into the messages!, P.S The prompt is massive.
